## Updated: Dec 2024 - .USDZ file interpretation in iPhone.

### Issue:
When you try to access to an .USDZ file directly from the browser, most hosts, automatically download the file.

### Resolution:
Use JSDelivr to make the iPhone read the file instead of downloading it, automatically opens AR Viewer.

### Example:
Link to access the file directly from the browser:
